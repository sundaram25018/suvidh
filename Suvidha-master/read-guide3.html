            10 Tips 

            <br><br>Drop, Cover, and Hold On: When you feel the shaking of an earthquake, follow the "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" technique. Drop to the ground to prevent being knocked over, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.

            <br><br>Stay Indoors: If you are inside a building during an earthquake, avoid running outside as falling debris can be dangerous. Instead, stay indoors, away from windows, glass, and heavy objects that could fall.

            <br><br>Stay Clear of Hazards: Keep away from windows, glass doors, and exterior walls to avoid injury from shattered glass. Stay clear of heavy furniture, hanging objects, and appliances that could topple over.

            <br><br>Find Safe Spots: Identify safe spots in every room, such as under sturdy tables or against interior walls. Avoid standing near doorways as they are not as safe as commonly thought.

            <br><br>Be Mindful of Elevators: If you are in a building, avoid using elevators during an earthquake as they may become stuck or malfunction.

            <br><br>Stay Calm: Keep calm during the earthquake and reassure others around you. Panic can lead to accidents and injuries.

            <br><br>Evacuate if Necessary: If you are in a coastal area and feel a strong earthquake, move immediately to higher ground as it could trigger a tsunami.

            <br><br>After the Shaking Stops: Check yourself and others for injuries. Be prepared for aftershocks and remain cautious as they may cause further damage.

            <br><br>Listen to Authorities: Follow the instructions given by local authorities and emergency services. Be aware of emergency evacuation routes and shelters in your area.

            <br><br>Prepare an Emergency Kit: Have an earthquake emergency kit ready with essential supplies like food, water, first aid items, flashlight, batteries, a battery-operated radio, and necessary medications.
